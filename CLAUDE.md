# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

go-llmspell: **Scriptable LLM interactions** via Lua, JavaScript, and Tengo. Bridges go-llms v0.3.5 to scripts without reimplementing features.

## Current Status

âœ… **Phase 1 COMPLETE** [2025-06-17]: 38+ bridges, zero business logic duplication  
ðŸš§ **Phase 2 NEXT**: Lua Engine Implementation

## Architecture

**Fundamental Rule**: If it's not in go-llms, we don't implement it.

```
/pkg/engine/     # Script engine interfaces (our code)
/pkg/bridge/     # Thin wrappers around go-llms (no business logic)
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Read TODO.md** for current tasks
2. **Write tests first** (TDD mandatory)
3. **Implement feature** (bridge only, no business logic)
4. **Run `make all`** (fmt, vet, lint, test, build)
5. **Update TODO-DONE.md** when complete

## Key Commands

```bash
make all   # Run complete dev cycle
make test  # Test with race detection
make lint  # Check code quality
```

## Implementation Rules

- **Bridge only** - Wrap go-llms, don't reimplement
- **Test everything** - Table-driven tests
- **Thread-safe** - Proper locking
- **No mocks** - Only in test files

## Important Files

- **TODO.md** - Current tasks (Phase 2+)
- **TODO-DONE.md** - Completed Phase 2+ tasks
- **TODO-DONE-ARCHIVE.md** - Phase 1 history
