# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

go-llmspell is a Go library that provides a scriptable interface for LLM interactions using embedded scripting languages (starting with Lua, then JavaScript and Tengo). It acts as a wrapper around the go-llms library, providing scripting capabilities for AI agent orchestration and workflow automation.

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ No active phase - ready for Phase 6 (Workflow System) or Phase 7 (Spell System)

### Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 6: Workflow System
   - Create workflow engine (`pkg/workflows/engine.go`)
   - Implement step execution logic
   - Add conditional branching and parallel execution
   - Create workflow bridge for scripts
2. Alternative: Begin Phase 7: Spell System
   - Create spell loader and runner
   - Implement spell metadata parsing
   - Add spell packaging format
3. Add missing features (lower priority):
   - llm.stream_chat_with_history() for message-based streaming
   - Safe alternatives to io.read/write for interactive spells
   - Additional agent examples (multi-turn conversation)
4. Investigate and integrate more built-in tools from go-llms

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a layered architecture:

1. **Spell Layer**: User-created scripts in Lua/JS/Tengo
2. **Script Engine Layer**: Language-specific interpreters with common interface
3. **Bridge Layer**: Go code exposing functionality to scripts
4. **go-llms Layer**: Core LLM library integration

### Key Components
- **Engine Interface**: Common abstraction for all script engines
- **Registry System**: Manages engines, tools, and agents
- **Bridge Pattern**: Clean separation between Go and script environments
- **Security**: Sandboxing with resource limits

## Development Guidelines

### Testing Strategy (TDD)
1. Write tests before implementation
2. Use table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
3. Mock external dependencies
4. Aim for >80% test coverage

### Code Style
- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add godoc comments for all exported types
- Keep functions focused and small

### Security First
- Implement sandboxing from the start
- Validate all inputs
- Enforce resource limits
- Use context for cancellation

### Commit Workflow
1. Create feature branch
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run `make fmt`, `make vet`, `make lint`, `make test`
5. Fix any issues before committing
6. Update documentation as needed

## Key Dependencies
- `github.com/lexlapax/go-llms` v0.2.6 - Core LLM wrapper library (integrated)
- `github.com/yuin/gopher-lua` v1.1.1 - Lua scripting engine (integrated)
- `github.com/joho/godotenv` v1.5.1 - Environment file loading (integrated)
- `github.com/dop251/goja` - JavaScript scripting engine (to be added)
- `github.com/d5/tengo` - Tengo scripting engine (to be added)

## Important Notes
- Always use TDD approach for new features
- Run quality checks (fmt, vet, lint, test) after feature completion
- Refer to TODO.md for current tasks and priorities
- Check TODO-DONE.md for completed work reference

### Development Principles
- **TDD Approach**: Write tests before implementation for all new features
- **Security First**: Implement sandboxing and validation from the start
- **Thread Safety**: Use mutex protection for all shared resources
- **Registry Pattern**: Follow established patterns for extensibility

### Post-Feature Workflow
```bash
# Run complete quality check pipeline
make fmt vet lint test build

# Or use the all target
make all
```

### Dependency Management
- Never change underlying dependency libraries even if you have access to source via git sub-modules
- Always use `go mod tidy` after adding dependencies
- Keep go-llms submodule as reference only, use Go module for actual dependency

### Environment Setup
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys:
  ```bash
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
  GEMINI_API_KEY=AI...
  ```
- The CLI automatically loads `.env` file if present
- Use `make example-mock SPELL=<name>` to run examples without API keys

### Debugging and Development Tips
- Use `make test` for development (includes race detection)
- Use `make coverage` to see test coverage reports
- Enable debug logging in spells with `log.set_level("debug")`
- Use `make watch` for automatic rebuilds during development (requires air)
- Check `/examples/spells/` for implementation patterns

### Script Engine Development (Lua)
- Security sandbox disables dangerous functions (os.execute, io operations)
- Use stdlib modules: json, http, storage, log, promise
- Agents can be created in Lua using `agents.register()`
- Tools can be registered from Lua using `tools.register()`
- Promises use `.next()` instead of `then()` (reserved keyword in Lua)

## Additional Context and Reminders

### LLM Integration Patterns
- **Provider Switching**: Use `llm.set_provider()` to switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini
- **Model Selection**: Use `llm.set_model()` after setting provider
- **Streaming**: Use `llm.stream_chat()` with callback functions for real-time responses
- **Async Patterns**: Use Promise system in Lua for parallel operations

### Built-in Tools Available
- **web_fetch**: Fetch content from URLs (built into go-llms)
- **calculator**: Basic mathematical operations
- **string_tools**: Text manipulation (reverse, uppercase, etc.)
- **json_processor**: JSON validation and transformation
- Scripts can register additional tools using `tools.register()`

### Agent System Patterns
- **Default Agents**: Use `agents.create()` to create go-llms wrapped agents
- **Lua Agents**: Register custom agents using `agents.register()` with function or table
- **Tool Integration**: Agents can use any registered tools
- **Streaming**: Use `agents.stream()` for streaming agent responses

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for all components using TDD
- Integration tests for full spell execution
- Race detection enabled by default in test runs
- Mock implementations available for testing without API keys
- Benchmarks for performance-critical components

### Security Implementation
- Filesystem access completely sandboxed
- Network requests restricted to HTTPS
- Resource limits enforced (memory, CPU, goroutines)
- Dangerous Lua functions disabled (os.execute, io.*, debug.*)
- Storage module provides safe file operations

### Common Development Tasks
- **Single Test**: `go test ./pkg/specific/package -v`
- **Race Detection**: `go test -race ./...`
- **With Coverage**: `go test -cover ./pkg/...`
- **Specific Function**: `go test -run TestFunctionName ./pkg/package`
- **Integration Only**: `make test-integration`
- **Benchmarks**: `go test -bench=. ./pkg/...`
