go-llmspell: **Scriptable LLM interactions** via Lua, JavaScript, and Tengo. Bridges go-llms v0.3.5 to scripts without reimplementing features.

## Current Status

üöß **Phase 3.2: Core CLI Implementation ACTIVE - NEEDS FIXES**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues Found (2025-06-21):**
- Runner package has skipped tests (.skip files)
- Using SimpleExecutor instead of full executor
- CLI commands are stubs returning "not implemented"
- No actual engine integration - scripts don't execute

**Completed Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Task 3.2.1: Configuration Foundation [COMPLETED - 2025-06-20]
- ‚úÖ Task 3.2.2: Error Handling Infrastructure [COMPLETED - 2025-06-21]
- ‚úÖ Task 3.2.3: Core Runner Package [PARTIALLY COMPLETE - needs fixes]
- ‚úÖ Task 3.2.4: Security & Validation Integration [COMPLETED - 2025-06-21]
- ‚úÖ Task 3.2.5: CLI Structure with Kong [STRUCTURE ONLY - needs implementation]

**Current Priority:**
- üî¥ Task 3.2.5.1: Fix Runner Package Tests
- üî¥ Task 3.2.5.2: Wire Up Full Executor Implementation
- Next: Task 3.2.6: REPL Implementation

**Completed Milestones**:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Engine & Bridge Foundation (38+ bridges)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Complete Lua Engine Implementation
  - Full Lua engine with async/coroutine support
  - Comprehensive Lua stdlib (18 modules) with complete test coverage
  - Development Tools: Debugger & Script Validator with 100% coverage
- ‚úÖ Phase 3.1: Spell Runner Research & Planning

## Architecture

**Fundamental Rule**: If it's not in go-llms, we don't implement it.

```
/pkg/engine/     # Script engine interfaces (our code)
/pkg/bridge/     # Thin wrappers around go-llms (no business logic)
/pkg/testutils/  # Centralized test utilities
/cmd/llmspell/   # CLI implementation (Phase 3)
/pkg/config/     # Configuration management (Phase 3)
/pkg/runner/     # Script execution runtime (Phase 3)
```

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Be thorough** - No shortcuts or deferrals. Ask questions when needed
2. **TDD mandatory** - Write tests first, use testutils
3. **Bridge-first** - Wrap go-llms, never reimplement  
4. **Research go-llms** - Check git submodule first
5. **Run `make all`** - Complete dev cycle
6. **Use and Update TODO.md** - Mark done tasks with timestamps, use to track project progression

## Commands

```bash
make all   # fmt, vet, lint, test, build
make test  # Test with race detection  
make lint  # Check code quality
```

## Phase 3 Focus: Spell Runner CLI

See TODO.md for detailed task list (3.2.1 through 3.2.9)

## Key Reminders

- **Complete tasks fully** - No lazy implementations or deferrals
- Do what's asked; nothing more, nothing less
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Never create docs unless explicitly requested
- If it's in go-llms, bridge it - don't reimplement
- **Phase 3 Ready**: Lua engine is production-ready for CLI integration
