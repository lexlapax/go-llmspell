# Status Update: June 12, 2025

## Overview

Successfully completed Phase 1.1 (Script Engine Interface) of the go-llmspell v0.3.3 migration. This establishes the foundation for the multi-engine architecture supporting Lua, JavaScript, and Tengo scripting languages.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1.1: Script Engine Interface ✅

All seven tasks in this phase have been completed with full test coverage:

1. **Core Interfaces** (Task 1.1.1)
   - ScriptEngine interface for language-agnostic script execution
   - Bridge interface for exposing Go functionality to scripts
   - TypeConverter interface for handling type conversions

2. **Engine Registry** (Task 1.1.2)
   - Thread-safe engine registration and discovery
   - Factory pattern for engine creation
   - Runtime engine switching support

3. **Type System** (Task 1.1.3)
   - Common type representations across engines
   - Comprehensive type conversion utilities
   - Type validation and error handling

4. **Bridge Manager** (Task 1.1.4)
   - Lifecycle management for bridges
   - Dependency resolution between bridges
   - Hot-reloading capabilities
   - Thread-safe operations

5. **Core LLM Bridge** (Task 1.1.5)
   - Integration with go-llms provider interface
   - Support for multiple LLM providers
   - Streaming and non-streaming completions
   - Provider switching and management

6. **Essential Utilities Bridge** (Task 1.1.6)
   - JSON parsing and manipulation
   - Environment variable access
   - Basic authentication utilities
   - Error handling helpers

7. **Model Info Bridge** (Task 1.1.7)
   - Model discovery and inventory
   - Provider-specific model fetchers
   - Caching with configurable TTL
   - Model filtering capabilities

## Technical Achievements

- **100% Test-Driven Development**: Every component has tests written before implementation
- **Thread Safety**: All components are designed for concurrent access
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between engine-specific and engine-agnostic code
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All tests pass with race detection enabled
- **Code Quality**: All code passes fmt, vet, and lint checks (0 issues)

## Updated Documentation

- **TODO.md**: Section 1.1 marked as complete, moved to header
- **TODO-DONE.md**: Added detailed completion records with timestamps
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated current status and completed components
- **README.md**: Simplified status section, removed legacy information
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Added v0.1.0-alpha entry with comprehensive details
- **docs/README.md**: Updated version information

## Next Steps

The foundation is now in place to begin Phase 1.2: Core Agent System (Engine-Agnostic), which includes:
- Agent Interface design
- Base Agent Implementation
- Agent Registry
- Agent Context management

## File Structure

The implemented components are organized as follows:
```
/pkg/engine/
├── interface.go      # Core interfaces
├── registry.go       # Engine registry
└── types.go         # Type system

/pkg/bridge/
├── manager.go       # Bridge lifecycle manager
├── llm.go          # LLM provider bridge
├── util.go         # Utilities bridge
└── modelinfo.go    # Model information bridge
```

All components have corresponding test files with comprehensive coverage.

## Migration Notes

This is a clean-slate implementation for the v0.3.3 architecture. The legacy Lua-only implementation remains in place but will be superseded by the new multi-engine design as development progresses.
