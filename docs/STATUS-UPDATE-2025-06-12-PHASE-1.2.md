# Status Update: June 12, 2025 - Phase 1.2 Complete

## Overview

Successfully completed Phase 1.2 (Core Agent System) of the go-llmspell v0.3.3 migration. This implements the engine-agnostic agent system that will power multi-engine script execution.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1.2: Core Agent System ✅

All four tasks in this phase have been completed with full test coverage:

1. **Agent Interface** (Task 1.2.1)
   - Core Agent interface with lifecycle methods (Init, Run, Cleanup)
   - Extension interfaces (ExtendedAgent, AsyncAgent, ConfigurableAgent)
   - Metadata and capability declaration system
   - Engine-independent design

2. **Base Agent Implementation** (Task 1.2.2)
   - Thread-safe state management
   - Event emission system with pub/sub pattern
   - Error handling with retry mechanisms
   - Comprehensive metrics collection
   - Support for all agent interfaces

3. **Agent Registry** (Task 1.2.3)
   - Thread-safe agent registration and discovery
   - Capability-based filtering
   - Dynamic lifecycle management
   - Agent templating system
   - Health monitoring and reporting

4. **Agent Context** (Task 1.2.4)
   - Execution context with resource limits (memory, CPU)
   - Cancellation and timeout support
   - Distributed tracing integration
   - Multi-engine execution contexts
   - Hook system for lifecycle events

## Technical Achievements

- **Complete TDD Coverage**: All components developed test-first
- **Thread Safety**: Comprehensive concurrent access protection
- **Resource Management**: Memory and CPU limit enforcement
- **Event-Driven**: Full pub/sub event system implementation
- **Tracing Support**: Built-in distributed tracing with spans
- **Clean Code**: All tests pass, 0 lint issues after fixes

## Key Features Implemented

### Agent System
- Lifecycle management (init → running → cleanup)
- State management with concurrent access control
- Event emission and subscription system
- Error recovery with configurable retry policies
- Metrics collection for monitoring
- Asynchronous operation support

### Agent Registry
- Global and custom registry instances
- Capability-based agent discovery
- Template system for agent creation
- Batch operations support
- Health monitoring and reporting
- Thread-safe concurrent operations

### Agent Context
- Resource limit enforcement (memory, CPU)
- Context propagation with cancellation
- Distributed tracing with span management
- Multi-engine execution isolation
- Before/After execution hooks
- Metadata management

## Code Quality

- All tests pass with race detection enabled
- Fixed all lint issues (18 issues resolved)
- Code follows established patterns
- Comprehensive godoc documentation
- Thread-safe implementations throughout

## Updated Documentation

- **TODO.md**: Section 1.2 marked as complete
- **TODO-DONE.md**: Added detailed completion records
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated status and architecture
- **README.md**: Updated current status
- **Makefile**: Updated migration status

## Next Steps

With the agent system complete, the next phase to evaluate is:
- Phase 1.3: State Management System (need to verify if required or already in go-llms)
- Phase 1.4: Universal Bridge System (27 tasks for comprehensive bridging)

The foundation is now solid with both the engine system and agent system in place.

## Statistics

- **Files Created**: 8 (4 implementation, 4 test files)
- **Tests Written**: 70+ test cases
- **Lines of Code**: ~4,000 lines
- **Interfaces Defined**: 4 major interfaces
- **Time to Complete**: ~2 hours
