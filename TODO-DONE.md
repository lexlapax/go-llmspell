### Post-Phase 2.2 Fixes [COMPLETED - 2025-06-18]

#### Race Condition Fix in Timeout Handling
- ✅ **Issue**: Data race when script execution timed out - goroutine was still running PCall() while pool shutdown was closing the state
- ✅ **Root Cause**: LState is not thread-safe and cannot be closed while PCall() is executing
- ✅ **Solution Implemented**:
  - ✅ Enhanced pooledState struct with `executing` flag and `done` channel to track execution state
  - ✅ Modified pool.Get() to mark states as executing with proper synchronization
  - ✅ Modified pool.Put() to mark states as not executing and signal completion
  - ✅ Created pool.AbandonState() method for safe timeout handling without closing states
  - ✅ Updated pool.Shutdown() to wait for executing states before closing (max 2s timeout)
  - ✅ Modified ExecutionPipeline to use AbandonState() on timeout instead of closing
  - ✅ Added comprehensive tests validating all scenarios (later consolidated into pool_test.go)
- ✅ **Key Design Decision**: Let abandoned states complete naturally instead of forcing closure
- ✅ **Result**: Clean timeout handling with no race conditions, respecting GopherLua's thread safety model
- ✅ **Test Organization**: Consolidated pool_abandon_test.go into pool_test.go for better maintainability

- ✅ **Task 2.3.X: Section Reordering for Optimal Implementation Dependencies** [COMPLETED - 2025-06-20]
  - ✅ **Critical Dependency Analysis**: Identified that async/coroutines must come before bridge adapters
    - ✅ Async operations are foundational for bridge operations (streaming, timeouts, concurrency)
    - ✅ Example spells already expect promise-based APIs from bridges
    - ✅ Architecture docs emphasize "Coroutine-Based Async: Non-blocking bridge operations"
  - ✅ **Section Reordering Completed**: Moved async foundation before bridge implementation
    - ✅ **2.3.2: Async/Coroutine Support** (moved from 2.3.4) - Foundation layer
    - ✅ **2.3.3: Bridge Adapters** (renumbered from 2.3.2) - Uses async foundation
    - ✅ **2.3.4: Lua Standard Library** (renumbered from 2.3.3) - Uses bridges + async
  - ✅ **Benefits**: Avoids retrofitting async to bridges, enables promise-based bridge APIs from day one
  - ✅ **Alignment**: Matches architecture's async-first philosophy and existing example spell patterns
