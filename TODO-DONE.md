## Phase 2: Lua Engine Implementation

### 2.1 Lua Engine Research and Planning
- ✅ **Task 2.1.1: Research gopher-lua integration** [COMPLETED - 2025-06-17]
  - ✅ Researched GopherLua (github.com/yuin/gopher-lua) - Lua 5.1 VM in Go
  - ✅ Analyzed LState management - not thread-safe, requires pooling
  - ✅ Identified type system: LValue interface with all Lua types + LChannel
  - ✅ Documented security features: library restrictions, resource limits
  - ✅ Created `/docs/technical/lua_engine_research.md`
  - ✅ Added 14 additional research tasks based on findings
  - ✅ Expanded implementation tasks with specific technical requirements

- ✅ **Task 2.1.2: Analyze LState management and pooling strategies** [COMPLETED - 2025-06-17]
  - ✅ Confirmed LState is NOT thread-safe - each goroutine needs own instance
  - ✅ Researched pooling patterns from official docs and community
  - ✅ Identified reset requirements: stack cleanup, global env, registry
  - ✅ Created `/docs/technical/lstate_management_analysis.md` with comprehensive analysis
  - ✅ Created `/docs/technical/lstate_pool_design.md` with implementation design
  - ✅ Designed thread-safe pool with lifecycle management
  - ✅ Included metrics, health checks, and graceful shutdown
  - ✅ Planned integration with ScriptEngine interface

- ✅ **Task 2.1.3: Design ScriptValue ↔ LValue type conversion system** [COMPLETED - 2025-06-17]
  - ✅ Mapped all LValue types to ScriptValue equivalents
  - ✅ Designed bidirectional conversion architecture with LuaTypeConverter
  - ✅ Created `/docs/technical/lua_type_conversion_design.md` with full implementation design
  - ✅ Created `/docs/technical/lua_type_conversion_examples.md` with practical examples
  - ✅ Handled complex types: Bridge objects as UserData, circular references
  - ✅ Included performance optimizations: caching, lazy conversion
  - ✅ Designed error handling with detailed conversion paths
  - ✅ Planned function wrapping for Go ↔ Lua function calls
  - ✅ Added support for channels (LChannel) and coroutines

- ✅ **Task 2.1.4: Plan goroutine and channel integration** [COMPLETED - 2025-06-17]
  - ✅ Confirmed LState concurrency model: one LState per goroutine
  - ✅ Designed channel-based communication using LChannel
  - ✅ Created `/docs/technical/lua_goroutine_channel_design.md` with architecture
  - ✅ Created `/docs/technical/lua_concurrency_examples.md` with patterns
  - ✅ Designed GoroutineManager for spawning Lua scripts in goroutines
  - ✅ Documented channel operations API (send, receive, select, close)
  - ✅ Identified type restrictions for channel safety
  - ✅ Included advanced patterns: worker pools, pipelines, fan-out/fan-in
  - ✅ Planned integration with async bridge operations

- ✅ **Task 2.1.5: Design security sandboxing approach** [COMPLETED - 2025-06-17]
  - ✅ Researched Lua sandbox techniques and GopherLua security features
  - ✅ Created `/docs/technical/lua_security_sandbox_design.md` with comprehensive design
  - ✅ Created `/docs/technical/lua_sandbox_examples.md` with practical examples
  - ✅ Designed whitelist-based security model
  - ✅ Identified safe vs unsafe libraries and functions
  - ✅ Implemented multiple security layers: library restrictions, resource limits, monitoring
  - ✅ Designed instruction count, memory, and timeout enforcement
  - ✅ Created sandbox configurations for different security levels
  - ✅ Included escape attempt prevention and testing strategies

- ✅ **Task 2.1.6: Research compiled chunk caching for performance** [COMPLETED - 2025-06-17]
  - ✅ Researched GopherLua's compilation process: Parse → Compile → FunctionProto
  - ✅ Identified caching opportunity: FunctionProto bytecode is read-only and shareable
  - ✅ Created `/docs/technical/lua_chunk_caching_design.md` with caching architecture
  - ✅ Designed ChunkCache with thread-safe operations and cache key generation
  - ✅ Implemented memory management with size estimation and eviction policies (LRU, TTL)
  - ✅ Designed file-based caching with modification time tracking
  - ✅ Included AST optimizations: constant folding, dead code elimination
  - ✅ Added disk persistence for cache warming across restarts
  - ✅ Designed integration patterns with LuaEngine and LStatePool
  - ✅ Included performance metrics and benchmarking strategies
