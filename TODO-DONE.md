## Bug Fixes and Improvements

### Provider Initialization Fix

  - All three providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) now initialize correctly
  - Added documentation for environment setup
  - Updated README with API key setup instructions

### Async Implementation
- [x] Implemented true async callbacks for Lua
  - Created async_callback.go for managing async operations
  - Added llm.chat_async() and llm.complete_async() methods
  - Integrated with promise system for parallel execution
  - Fixed async-callbacks example to use real async calls
  - Note: Provider switching limitations prevent true parallel calls across providers

## Notes on Implementation Decisions

1. **Promise Implementation**: Used `.next()` instead of `then()` in Lua due to `then` being a reserved keyword
2. **Security First**: All filesystem access is sandboxed, dangerous functions disabled
3. **Thread Safety**: All registries and shared resources use mutex protection
4. **TDD Approach**: Tests written before implementation for all major components
5. **Provider Initialization**: Requires proper environment variables or .env file with API keys
