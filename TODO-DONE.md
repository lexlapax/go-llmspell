  - Set up cmd/llmspell/main.go with basic CLI
  - Created package structure in /pkg/
  - Added documentation files in /docs/
  - Created example scripts in /examples/

- [x] Architecture documentation
  - Created comprehensive architecture.md
  - Created implementation-guide.md
  - Created spell-development.md
  - Updated docs/README.md with navigation

- [x] go-llms dependency integration
  - Added go-llms v0.2.6 as git submodule
  - Configured go.mod with dependency
  - Vendored dependencies
  - Created initial LLM bridge in pkg/bridge/llm.go

### Infrastructure Components (Completed)
- [x] Basic project structure with Makefile
- [x] .gitignore for Go projects
- [x] Initial engine interface design (pkg/engine/engine.go)
- [x] Initial spell management structure (pkg/spells/spell.go)

## Implementation Notes

### LLM Bridge Status
The LLM bridge has been partially implemented with:
- Provider detection from environment variables
- Basic chat functionality
- Completion with max tokens support
- Streaming support using go-llms ResponseStream

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Completed: December 2024)

### 1.1 Engine Interface System
- [x] Create `pkg/engine/interface.go` with core `Engine` interface (using existing engine.go)
  - Implemented comprehensive Engine interface with LoadScript, ExecuteScript, SetVariable, GetVariable, RegisterFunction methods
  - Created ExecutionResult type with output, error handling, and execution time tracking
  - Defined EngineConfig with memory limits, timeouts, and security settings
  - Complete test coverage with TDD approach

- [x] Implement `ExecutionResult` and `LogEntry` types (adapted to existing Result type)
  - ExecutionResult includes Output, Error, ExecutionTime, and Logs
  - LogEntry supports different log levels (Debug, Info, Warn, Error)
  - Proper JSON marshaling support

- [x] Define `EngineConfig` with memory limits and timeouts (adapted to existing Config type)
  - Memory limits (MaxMemory)
  - CPU time limits (MaxExecutionTime)
  - Goroutine limits (MaxGoroutines)
  - Security policy settings

- [x] Create `pkg/engine/errors.go` for engine-specific errors
  - ScriptError for runtime errors with line/column info
  - LoadError for script loading failures
  - ConfigError for invalid configurations
  - SecurityError for security violations
  - Helper functions for error creation and checking

### 1.2 Engine Registry
- [x] Implement `pkg/engine/registry.go` with thread-safe registry
  - Global registry with mutex protection
  - Thread-safe Register and Get operations
  - Support for multiple engine instances

- [x] Add factory pattern for engine creation
  - EngineFactory interface with Create method
  - Factory registration in registry
  - Metadata support for engines

- [x] Create registry tests
  - Comprehensive test coverage
  - Concurrency tests
  - Edge case handling

- [x] Add engine discovery mechanism
  - Auto-discovery by file extension
  - MIME type support
  - Language name lookup

### 1.3 Bridge Infrastructure
- [x] Define `pkg/bridge/interface.go` with `Bridge` interface
  - Bridge interface with Register and Unregister methods
  - Support for registering Go functions to script engines
  - Clean separation between Go and script environments

- [x] Implement `BridgeSet` for managing multiple bridges
  - Thread-safe bridge collection
  - Add/Remove/Get operations
  - Iteration support with callback

- [x] Create bridge registration mechanism
  - RegisterAll for bulk registration
  - UnregisterAll for cleanup
  - Type-safe registration

- [x] Add bridge lifecycle management (init/cleanup)
  - Lifecycle interface with Initialize and Cleanup methods
  - Proper initialization order
  - Cleanup on shutdown

### 1.4 Context and Security
- [x] Implement `pkg/security/context.go` for secure execution contexts
  - SecurityContext with resource limits
  - Context integration for cancellation
  - Resource usage tracking

- [x] Create resource tracking for memory/CPU limits
