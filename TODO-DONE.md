## Architecture Cleanup - [Date: 2025-06-12]

### ✅ 0.1 Clean Architecture (Immediate Actions)

Based on the bridge-first architecture revision in docs/MIGRATION_PLAN_V0.3.3.md, the following cleanup actions were completed:

- ✅ **DELETED `/pkg/core/agent/`** directory entirely - Removed all agent-related code that was duplicating go-llms functionality
- ✅ **DELETED `/pkg/core/`** directory - Removed after it was empty following agent removal
- ✅ **VERIFIED** no imports of deleted packages remain - Searched all Go files and confirmed no references to pkg/core/agent or pkg/core

**Rationale**: The agent system was creating unnecessary abstraction and duplicating functionality that already exists in go-llms. Per the bridge-first architecture, we should bridge to go-llms agents rather than building our own parallel system.

**Result**: Clean two-package architecture achieved:
- `/pkg/engine/` - Script engine interfaces and implementations (our core value)
- `/pkg/bridge/` - Bridges to go-llms functionality (not reimplementing)

All tests pass after deletion, confirming no dependencies on the removed code.

---


**Bridge Interface Compliance:**
- Implemented full engine.Bridge interface (GetID, GetMetadata, Initialize, Cleanup, etc.)
- Proper lifecycle management with initialization and cleanup
- Required permissions declaration for memory access
- Method validation and type mappings

**State Management Operations:**
- Complete state lifecycle: create, save, load, delete, list operations
- Data operations: get, set, delete, has, keys, values for state data
- Metadata operations: set, get, and bulk retrieve metadata
- Artifact operations: add, get, and list artifacts in state
- Message operations: add and retrieve messages from state

**Transform System:**
- Built-in transforms automatically registered (filter, flatten, sanitize)
- Custom transform registration and application
- Context-aware transform execution

**Validation Framework:**
- Custom validator registration
- State validation with detailed error reporting
- Parameter validation for all operations

**Merge Strategies:**
- Support for Last, MergeAll, and Union merge strategies
- Strategy validation with clear error messages
- Multi-state merging operations

**Testing:**
- Comprehensive test coverage with simplified test approach
- Interface compliance tests
- Error handling tests
- Built-in transform tests
- All tests passing with proper lint compliance

**Architecture:**
- Clean bridge pattern following go-llmspell principles
- Type-safe conversions between Go and script types
- Thread-safe operations where needed
- Proper error handling and reporting

This implementation provides the foundation for state management in scripts while leveraging the existing go-llms state management system through proper bridging rather than reimplementation.
