## Architecture Cleanup - [Date: 2025-06-12]

### ✅ 0.1 Clean Architecture (Immediate Actions)

Based on the bridge-first architecture revision in docs/MIGRATION_PLAN_V0.3.3.md, the following cleanup actions were completed:

- ✅ **DELETED `/pkg/core/agent/`** directory entirely - Removed all agent-related code that was duplicating go-llms functionality
- ✅ **DELETED `/pkg/core/`** directory - Removed after it was empty following agent removal
- ✅ **VERIFIED** no imports of deleted packages remain - Searched all Go files and confirmed no references to pkg/core/agent or pkg/core

**Rationale**: The agent system was creating unnecessary abstraction and duplicating functionality that already exists in go-llms. Per the bridge-first architecture, we should bridge to go-llms agents rather than building our own parallel system.

**Result**: Clean two-package architecture achieved:
- `/pkg/engine/` - Script engine interfaces and implementations (our core value)
- `/pkg/bridge/` - Bridges to go-llms functionality (not reimplementing)

All tests pass after deletion, confirming no dependencies on the removed code.
