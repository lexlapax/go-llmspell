# TODO: Go-LLMSpell Multi-Engine Architecture Implementation

## Overview
This TODO tracks the implementation of go-llmspell's multi-engine architecture supporting Lua, JavaScript, and Tengo scripting languages, fully leveraging go-llms v0.3.3's multi-agent orchestration capabilities.

## Historical Progress (Legacy Implementation)
### Completed Phases (Prior to v0.3.3 Migration)
- ✅ **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** (Completed)
- ✅ **Phase 2: LLM Bridge Enhancement** (Completed)
- ✅ **Phase 3: Lua Engine Integration** (Completed)
- ✅ **Phase 4: Tool System** (Completed)
- ✅ **Phase 5: Agent System** (Completed)

### Migration Status
- ✅ Updated go-llms submodule from v0.2.6 to v0.3.0
- ✅ Fixed breaking changes in tool interfaces
- ✅ Updated tool names: read_file → file_read, write_file → file_write
- ✅ All tests passing with go-llms v0.3.0
- ⏳ Migration to v0.3.3 in progress (clean slate implementation)

---

## New Multi-Engine Architecture Implementation
No need for backward compatibility. clean room implementation. overwrite existing code. Delete duplicate old code after implementation. Always TDD , tests first and then code. after implementation need to run build, run tests, run lint, vet and fmt.
