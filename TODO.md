# TODO: Go-LLMSpell Bridge-First Implementation

## Overview
Based on the bridge-first architecture in `docs/MIGRATION_PLAN_V0.3.3.md`, this TODO focuses on **bridging existing go-llms functionality** rather than reimplementing features. Our value is making go-llms scriptable through Lua, JavaScript, and Tengo.

## Key Principles
1. **Fundamental Rule**: If it's not in go-llms, we don't implement it in go-llmspell
2. **Bridge, Don't Build**: We ONLY bridge existing go-llms functionality. Bridging also means imports from go-llms and implementing the bridge function calls in the bridge.
3. **Clean Architecture**: Just `pkg/engine/` and `pkg/bridge/` - no business logic
4. **Script Infrastructure Only**: We only build what's needed for scripting (engines, type conversion, sandboxing)
5. **Type Safety**: Maintain type conversions at bridge boundaries

## Notes

### Development Order
1. Complete core bridges (llm_agent, workflow, events, tools)
2. Implement provider and pool bridges
3. Complete Lua engine and stdlib
4. Add JavaScript engine
5. Add Tengo engine
6. Create comprehensive examples

### Testing Strategy
- TDD for all new code
- Test bridges thoroughly
- Cross-engine conformance tests
- Performance benchmarks

### What We DON'T Build (CRITICAL)
- ‚ùå **NO LLM Logic**: No provider implementations, no API calls, no response parsing
- ‚ùå **NO Agent Logic**: No agent orchestration, no tool execution logic
- ‚ùå **NO State Management**: No state storage, transforms, or merging logic
- ‚ùå **NO Workflow Engine**: No workflow execution or state passing
- ‚ùå **NO Event System**: No event dispatching or subscription logic
- ‚ùå **NO Tools Implementation**: No tool logic, only bridging to go-llms tools
- ‚ùå **NO Business Features**: If it should be in go-llms, contribute it there first
- ‚ùå **NO Custom Abstractions**: No "improved" versions of go-llms features

### What We DO Build (Our ONLY Value-Add)
- ‚úÖ **Script Engines**: Lua, JavaScript, Tengo execution environments
- ‚úÖ **Type Converters**: Script ‚Üî Go type conversion infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Bridge Interfaces**: Thin wrappers that expose go-llms to scripts
- ‚úÖ **Security Sandboxes**: Script execution isolation and resource limits
- ‚úÖ **Language Bindings**: Idiomatic script APIs for each language
- ‚úÖ **Examples/Documentation**: How to use go-llms from scripts

### If You're Tempted to Implement Something...
1. **STOP**: Does it exist in go-llms? ‚Üí Bridge it
2. **STOP**: Should it exist in go-llms? ‚Üí Contribute upstream first
3. **STOP**: Is it script-specific? ‚Üí Only then implement it here

---

**Remember**: If it exists in go-llms, we bridge it. We only build what's unique to our scripting layer.
